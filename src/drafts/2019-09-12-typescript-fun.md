Why the heck do we even need it?

- move errors from **runtime** to **compile** time ðŸ’¯ðŸ¤¯
- code serves as documentation
- breaking types breaks the "fast mode" (compiler all the )
- save me from my typos


How does it work

- implicit & explicit typing 
- shape equallity, not x is an instance of y (interfaces)
-- excess properties are cool


### Interface vs Class
- Fewer gotchas than classes

## Any & Never
- you're back to regular javascript, basically




### Things to avoid
